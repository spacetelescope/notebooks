# Notebooks

This repository contains a curated set of Jupyter notebooks related to the work that we do at STScI. These notebooks follow a consistent [style guide]( https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/issues/2) in terms of layout/structure, coding conventions etc.

These notebooks are also under continuous integration to ensure that astronomers using these notebooks have a high level of confidence that they will work.

## Contents

This repository holds the notebooks themselves, but in a harder-to-read unexecuted form. If you want to view the notebooks online, you should view [the rendered version](https://spacetelescope.github.io/notebooks).


## Contributing

If you want to suggest changes to this content (or new content!), check out the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
