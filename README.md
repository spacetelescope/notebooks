# Notebooks

This repository contains a curated set of Jupyter notebooks related to the work that we do at STScI. These notebooks follow a consistent<sup>\*</sup> [style guide]( https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/issues/2) in terms of layout/structure, coding conventions etc.

These notebooks are also under continuous integration<sup>\*</sup> to ensure that astronomers using these notebooks have a high level of confidence that they will work.
