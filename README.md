# Notebooks

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/spacetelescope/notebooks/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/spacetelescope/notebooks/tree/master)

This repository contains a curated set of Jupyter notebooks related to the work that we do at STScI. These notebooks follow a consistent [style guide](https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/blob/master/guides/jupyter-notebooks.md) in terms of layout/structure, coding conventions etc.

These notebooks are also under continuous integration to ensure that astronomers using these notebooks have a high level of confidence that they will work.

## Building Locally

Python 3 is required for use of these notebooks.

To quickly create an environment with everything needed to run and convert, please first install Conda or Miniconda to your machine using [Conda Installation Instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

Once you have Conda installed, complete the following from a command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/notebooks
cd notebooks
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate notebooks_env
python convert.py
```

Doing so will clone this repo, create and activate a conda environment with all needed dependencies, and convert the notebooks to html. For all current notebooks, this can take around 30 minutes.

After converting, you can access the converted HTML of the notebooks in each notebook directory. These can be opened in any web browser. You can also open the index.html file in the root of the repo after converting that links to all converted notebooks.

If you would like to view the notebooks in Jupyter, from the command line in the notebooks directory use:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Your web browser will open a new page and you can navigate the notebook directories and click the a notebook file (ends in .ipynb) to open.
