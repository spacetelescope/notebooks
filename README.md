# Notebooks

This repository contains a curated set of Jupyter notebooks related to the work that we do at STScI. These notebooks follow a consistent [style guide](https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/blob/master/guides/jupyter-notebooks.md) in terms of layout/structure, coding conventions etc.

These notebooks are also under continuous integration to ensure that astronomers using these notebooks have a high level of confidence that they will work.

## Contents

This repository holds the notebooks themselves, but in a harder-to-read unexecuted form. If you want to view the notebooks online, you should view [the rendered version](https://spacetelescope.github.io/notebooks).

### Building Locally

Alternatively, if you would like to execute the notebooks and view them locally, you can clone this repo and do ``python convert.py``. This requires the [nbpages](https://github.com/eteq/nbpages) python package, which you can most easily install by doing ``pip install -e git+https://github.com/eteq/nbpages.git#egg=nbpages``.
