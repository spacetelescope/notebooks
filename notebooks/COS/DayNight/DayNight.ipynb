    "You may wish to disaggregate photons from these two time periods, as data taken during the day can be subject to different and higher background noise conditions, as well as more intense geocoronal Lyman-alpha or Oxygen-I emission lines from the Earthâ€™s atmosphere ([See Data Handbook 5.4.2](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/cosdhb/chapter-5-cos-data-analysis/5-4-working-with-time-tag-data#id-5.4WorkingwithTIME-TAGData-5.4.2FilteringTime-TagData)).\n",
