However, as described in this [COS 2030 plan poster](https://aas240-aas.ipostersessions.com/default.aspx?s=06-68-AE-28-CC-4A-12-7A-B0-4F-02-46-BC-D1-BE-7E), this is not possible at LP6. Instead, separate wavelength calibration exposures are taken at separate lifetime positions in a process known as [SPLIT wavecals](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/cosihb/chapter-5-spectroscopy-with-cos/5-7-internal-wavelength-calibration-exposures#id-5.7InternalWavelengthCalibrationExposures-Section5.7.65.7.6SPLITWavecals(defaultnon-concurrentwavelengthcalibrationatLP6)).

If you wish to test it by running the `CalCOS` data calibration pipeline on it, you may run the file `test_splitwave_asn.py` in this directory. Note the following requirements: \n",

For more information on setting up such a directory, see [our Notebook on setting up an environment for COS data analysis](https://github.com/spacetelescope/notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/COS/Setup/Setup.ipynb)."
