    "- You will frequently see exclamation points (**\\!**) or dollar signs (**\\$**) at the beginning of a line of code. These are not part of the actual commands. The exclamation points tell a jupyter Notebook to pass the following line to the command line, and the dollar sign merely indicates the start of a terminal prompt. \n",

    "- If you install the full Anaconda distribution with the [*Anaconda Navigator* tool](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/), (see Section 1,) you will also have access to a graphical interface (AKA a way to use windows and a point-and-click interface instead of the terminal for installing packages and managing environments).\n",

    "- It is sometimes preferable to use another package manager - `pip` - to install necessary packages, however `conda` can be used to create Python environments as well as install packages. You may see both `pip` and `conda` used in these Notebooks."
