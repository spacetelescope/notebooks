    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use `TweakReg` and `AstroDrizzle` tasks to align and combine images. While this example focuses on ACS/WFC data, the procedure can be almost identically applied to WFC3/UVIS images. This notebook is based on [a prior example](http://documents.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/documents/DrizzlePac/ch75.html) from the 2012 [DrizzlePac Handbook](http://documents.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/documents/DrizzlePac/toc.html), but has been updated for compatibility with the STScI AstroConda software distribution.  There is a good deal of explanatory text in this notebook, and users new to DrizzlePac are encouraged to start with this tutorial. Additional DrizzlePac software documentation is available at [the readthedocs webpage](https://drizzlepac.readthedocs.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the notebook, you will need to install the `astroquery` package, which is used to retrieve the data from the MAST archive and the `ccdproc` package which is used to query the image headers. \n",

    "Summary of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the data from MAST using astroquery. \n",
    "2. Align the images to a common reference frame, and update the WCS using `TweakReg`.\n",
    "3. Combine the aligned images using `AstroDrizzle`."

These observations were acquired over a 3-month period in separate visits and at different orientations.

We finally select only 'FLC' data products using the parameter `productSubGroupDescription` while downloading the files.

    "\n",
    "In order to correctly align and combine multiple images into a distortion-free final drizzled product, `AstroDrizzle` relies on the World Coordinate System (WCS) information stored in the header of each image. Because the WCS information for an image is tied to the positions of guide stars used for the observation, each image will have small pointing errors offsets due to the uncertainty in guide star positions. The `TweakReg` software can align a set of images to better than subpixel accuracy (<0.1 pixel). All input images are aligned to one chosen reference image's WCS. The reference image is typically selected as the first image in the input list, but can be chosen explicitly via the `refimage` parameter, if desired.\n",

    "\n",
    "    1. Makes a catalog of source positions for each input (and reference) image using a source finding algorithm        similar to DAOFind. \n",

    "    3. Finds common source positions between reference and input image catalogs.\n",

    "In this example, we imported and ran the `AstroDrizzle` task on our input images, which were previously aligned with `TweakReg`. By setting `configobj` to None, we ensured that `AstroDrizzle` was not picking up any existing configuration files and parameters were restored to default values. We then set a select few parameters to non-default values:\n",
    "   1. `output = 'f606w_combined'` : Output file name root (which will be appended with various suffixes). Defaults to input file name.\n",
    "   2. `driz_sep_bits = '64,16'` : Data quality flags in the `flt.fits` file, which were set during calibration, can be used as bit mask when drizzling. The user may specify which bit values should actually be considered \"good\" and included in image combination. In `astrodrizzle`, this parameter may be given as the sum of those DQ flags or as a comma-separated list, as shown in this example. In this example, 64 and 16 are set, so that both warm pixels and stable hot pixels, which are corrected by the dark, are treated as valid input pixels.\n",
    "   3. `driz_cr_corr = True` : When set to True, the task will create both a cosmic ray mask image (suffix `crmask.fits`) and a clean version of the original input images (suffix `crclean.fits`), where flagged pixels are replaced by pixels from the blotted median. It is strongly recommended that the quality of the cosmic ray masks be verified by blinking the original `flt.fits` input image with both the cosmic ray-cleaned image (`crclean.fits`) and the cosmic-ray mask (`crmask.fits`).\n",
    "   4. `final_bits = '64,16'` : Similar to `driz_sep_bits`, but for the last step when all the input images are combined.\n",
    "   5. `clean = False` : intermediate output files (e.g masks) will be kept. If True, only main outputs will be kept. Also see `in_memory` to control this behavior.\n",

    "`AstroDrizzle` has a large number of parameters, which are [described here](https://drizzlepac.readthedocs.io/en/deployment/astrodrizzle.html). Running `AstroDrizzle` using default parameter values is not recommended, as these defaults may not provide optimal science products. Users should also inspect the quality of the sky subtraction and cosmic ray rejection. For dithered data, users may experiment with the output `final_scale` and `final_pixfrac` parameters in the `final_drizzle` step.
