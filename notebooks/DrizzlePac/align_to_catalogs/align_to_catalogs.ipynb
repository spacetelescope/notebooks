    "The alignment of HST exposures is a critical step in image stacking/combination performed by software such as `AstroDrizzle`.  Generally, a relative alignment is performed that aligns one image (or multiple images) to another image which is designated as the reference image.  This makes it so the images are aligned to each other, but the pointing error of the observatory can still cause the images to have incorrect absolute astrometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "When absolute astrometry is desired, the images can be aligned to an external catalog that is known to be on an absolute frame.  In this example, we will provide a workflow to query catalogs such as SDSS and Gaia via the astroquery package, and then align the images to that catalog via TweakReg.\n",

    "Many other services have interfaces for querying catalogs which could also be used to align HST images.  In general, Gaia works very well for HST due to it's high precision, but can have a low number of sources in some regions, especially at high galactic latitudes.  Aligning images to an absolute frame provides an easy way to make data comparable across many epochs/detectors/observatories, and in many cases, makes the alignment much easier."
