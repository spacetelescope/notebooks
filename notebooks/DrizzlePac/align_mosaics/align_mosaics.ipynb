    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to align and drizzle mosaicked tiles of the Eagle Nebula (M16) obtained with WFC3 with both UVIS and IR detectors. It is based on the example highlighted in the following WFC3 technical report: [ISR 2015-09: Combining WFC3 Mosaics of M16 with DrizzlePac](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/ISRs/WFC3-2015-09.pdf)\n",
    "and highlights special features in DrizzlePac to improve mosaics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In prior alignment [tutorials](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/heritage/horsehead/readme_HLSP_v3.txt), building up an aligned set of tiles required an iterative approach. Now, mosaic alignment can be achieved in a single step by building up an expanded reference catalog ‘on-the-fly’. New sky matching options make it easier to produce seamless mosaics, which can be challenging for extended sources with little or no blank sky. "

TweakReg has been enhanced to support the alignment of observations that cover a large area on the sky. Making use of the `expand_refcat` parameter, TweakReg will build up an expanded reference catalog on the sky to be used for alignment. When set to 'True', TweakReg selects two images from the input list with the largest overlap on the sky, generates source catalogs for each image, and computes a fit (shift, rotation, and/or scale change) from the matched source list. \n",

    "Next, the algorithm computes the area of overlap of each of these two images with the rest of the input images, and the one with the largest total overlap on the sky is selected as the reference image. Sources from the second image that have not been matched to the reference image catalog are considered good new sources and are added to the reference catalog. In this way, the reference catalog keeps expanding with each new matched image. With a large (expanded) reference catalog it is therefore possible to align images that had no direct overlap with the starting image."

    "\n",
    "For this large multi-filter dataset, the user should carefully consider which observations to align and combine first. These will serve as a reference image for aligning additional filters. The broadband IR images of M16 contain a large number of stars distributed uniformly over the field of view. The UVIS frames, on the other hand, are largely devoid of point sources and full of cosmic-rays which can trip up TweakReg when trying to compute a fit. Even though the IR detector has a smaller footprint on the sky and the IR PSF is more undersampled, the high density of stars makes it a better anchor for aligning the UVIS tiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the two IR filters, F160W has the largest number of point sources and therefore makes a good choice for the reference image. To generate source lists for matching, the TweakReg parameter `conv_width` should be set to approximately twice the FWHM of the PSF, ~2.5 pixels for IR observations and ~3.5 pixels for UVIS observations. TweakReg will automatically compute the standard deviation of the sky background (`skysigma`), so the number of sources in each catalog may be controlled simply by changing the ‘threshold’ parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, TweakReg is run in ‘non-interactive’ mode (`interactive='False'`) so that the astrometric fit residuals and vectors diagrams will be saved as png files in the user’s local directory for inspection. Once the parameters have been fine-tuned and the fit looks adequate, users may run TweakReg a second time (see below) to update the image header WCS keywords by setting the parameter `updatehdr` to True."

    "# 5. Mosaicking Features in AstroDrizzle\n",
    "\n",
    "AstroDrizzle now makes it easier for users to match the sky background when tiling together large mosaics. In prior versions of the software, the sky background was based on clipped statistics in each image separately. The sky background was measured for each chip and the lowest sky value (in electrons/arcsec^2) among all of the chips was adopted. For observations of sparse fields, this approach generally works well. However, when large extended objects fill the detector, there is no true 'blank sky' and the background value will be an overestimate. Additionally, when extended targets are observed as mosaics (e.g. with large dithers), the 'scene' can change significantly between exposures and bias the background estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "An error in determining the sky background may in turn impact the cosmic ray rejection, and if severe enough, the resulting photometry. Additionally, by not properly matching the sky background before combining frames, correlated noise will be added to the final drizzled products when differences in the background levels are significant. Until now, the recommended workaround has been for users to give AstroDrizzle an ASCII file (`skyfile`) containing user-defined background values. \n",
    "\n",
    "AstroDrizzle now features several new options for computing the sky. One of these, `skymethod='match'`, is useful for “equalizing” the sky background across large mosaics. This method computes differences in sky values using only pixels in common between images. The sky values will then be set relative to the value computed for the input frame with the lowest sky value for which the MDRIZSKY keyword will be set to 0. In this way, the sky background is not removed, but instead equalized before the data are combined. For more details on the sky matching functions used by AstroDrizzle, see the following [webpage](https://stsci-skypac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/skymatch.html)."

Note that users must first set the parameter `final_wcs='True'` in order to turn on parameters in AstroDrizzle’s step 7a: `Custom WCS for Final Output`. For these observations, the IR scale (0.08”/pixel) is chosen to be exactly twice that for the UVIS mosaics (0.04”/pixel) by setting `final_scale=0.08`, and the drizzled images have been oversized slightly to match the sky area on the sky covered by the UVIS.

This program included a blob dither, however, and so the 512 flag may be removed from the list of good DQ values such that these pixels will be replaced with non-flagged pixels from the accompanying dithered pair. \n",

    "\n",
    "The F160W drizzled mosaic defines the reference frame for aligning the UVIS filters. In [ISR 2015-09](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/ISRs/WFC3-2015-09.pdf), the UVIS visit-level DRC frames were aligned directly to the IR reference image, and this approach was chosen because the long UVIS exposures contain numerous cosmic-rays and relatively few point sources. The Drizzlepac task TweakBack was then used to propagate the updated WCS from the drizzled image header back to the individual FLC input frames making up each association prior to drizzling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the FLC frames may be aligned directly to the IR mosaic by making use of a new parameter in TweakReg which allows for specific flags in the DQ array of the FLC frames to be used or ignored. The `imagefindpars` parameter `dqbits` may be prepended with ‘~’ to the string value to indicate which DQ flags to consider as \"bad\" pixels. For example, when deriving source catalogs, Tweakreg will ignore any pixels flagged as cosmic-ray flags in the MAST visit-level drizzled data products when `dqbits` is set to ~4096. This dramatically cuts down the number of false detections due to cosmic rays in the input FLC science arrays. More details on `imagefindpars` options may be found on the following [webpage](https://drizzlepac.readthedocs.io/en/deployment/imagefindpars.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `threshold` value was manually adjusted to get ~50 matches per UVIS exposure. Note that setting the `threshold` to a very low value does not necessarily translate to a better solution, since all sources are weighted equally when computing fits to match catalogs. This is especially relevant for UVIS data where CTE tails can shift the centroid position slightly along the readout direction for faint sources and potentially bias the fit."

    "The full set of 12 FLC frames have now been aligned and may be drizzled to a mosaic exactly half the scale (0.04\"/pixel) of the original IR mosaic (0.08\"/pixel). The same output WCS paramters: `final_rot`,`final_ra`, and `final_dec` values are used, but the `final_outnx` and `final_outny` are now twice the size of the IR mosaic at 8000x9000 pixels. \n",

    "To save time for this notebook, the visit-level cosmic ray flags are assumed to be adequate, Steps 3, 4, 5, 6 are turned off, and the parameter `resetbits` is set to '0' to avoid wiping out the 4096 flags in the FLC data quality arrays. Also, the sky background levels have been provided via the skyfile parameter, but users would typically set `skymethod='match'` to compute the sky background levels. \n",

    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides the methodology for creating UVIS and IR mosaics of M16, as well as recommendations for key parameters. As such, it is relevant for users combining multi-visit observations from any HST imaging program, whether mosaics or single pointings. In this example, the IR F160W mosaic was chosen to define the reference frame, since it contained the largest number of point sources, despite the pixels being undersampled. Typically, the detector with the best resolution and PSF sampling would be selected as the reference, but in this case the UVIS catalogs were too sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building up an expanded reference catalog on the sky, TweakReg was allowed to select the order in which tiles were aligned, since it made little impact on the results. For aligning mosaics with more tiles, however, users are recommended to experiment with changing the order in which images are aligned and seeing how this changes the astrometric residuals.  Generally, users are advised to start from the center of the mosaic and work their way out to avoid propogation of errors across the mosaic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, mosaic tiles can be aligned directly to an absolute reference catalog such as GAIA, when a sufficient number of stars are available in the input frames for alignment. For more detail on this methodology, see the notebook 'aligning_to_catalogs.ipynb'. "
