    "DS9 is a popular [image visualization program](http://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html) used in astronomy. It is now a standard package in the [AstroConda channel](https://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). DS9 regions are interactive, user generated shapes which mark areas of interest. [Here is documentation](http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/region.html) about DS9 regions. For users with no experience with DS9, many resources exist online. One example is [this AstroBites page](https://astrobites.org/2011/03/09/how-to-use-sao-ds9-to-examine-astronomical-images/) which summarizes the most common DS9 features. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we show how [TweakReg](https://drizzlepac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tweakreg.html) can include and exclude sources identified by DS9 regions during image alignment. The use of \"excluded\" regions prevents spurious detections and ignores parts of the input images that might trouble a proper identification of sources for alignment. \"Included\" regions is particularly useful for images that have few good sources that can be used for image alignment and need all other sources not contained within these regions to be ignored. \n",

    "This notebook is based on a [prior example](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/drizzlepac/examples/example10) available from the [DrizzlePac webpage](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/drizzlepac). Please direct inquires about this notebook, DrizzlePac, or any other issues with HST images to the [HST help desk](https://stsci.service-now.com/hst)."
