    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra care must be taken when using `AstroDrizzle` to combine observations from detectors comprised of multiple chips of varying sensitivity. `AstroDrizzle` works with calibrated images in units of counts (electrons or Data Numbers) or count rates and not in units of flux. It assumes that all input frames can be converted to physical flux units using a single inverse-sensitivity factor, recorded in the FITS image headers as `PHOTFLAM`, and the output drizzled product simply copies the `PHOTFLAM` keyword value from the first input image. When this occurs, the inverse-sensitivity will vary across the final drizzled product, and users will need to keep track of which sources fell on which chip when doing photometry. Moreover, varying detector sensitivities will affect the cosmic-ray rejection algorithm used by `AstroDrizzle`, and this may result in the misidentification of some good pixels as cosmic rays.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a typical situation when drizzle-combining images from HST instruments with different chip sensitivities, e.g. Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). For more detail, see the section on [Gain Variation](http://www.stsci.edu/instruments/wfpc2/Wfpc2_dhb/wfpc2_ch53.html) under 'Position-Dependent Photometric Corrections' in the WFPC2 Data Handbook. As a result, each of the four chips requires a [unique PHOTFLAM](http://www.stsci.edu/instruments/wfpc2/Wfpc2_dhb/wfpc2_ch52.html#1933986) header keyword value. A similar situation may occur when drizzle-combining observations taken over a span of several years as detector's sensitivity declines over time, see e.g. [ACS ISR 2016-03](https://doi.org/10.3847/0004-6256/152/3/60).\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to rescale the input data so that `AstroDrizzle` can properly assume the images/chips have the same sensitivity; that is, a single `PHOTFLAM` value can be used to convert re-scaled image counts (or count-rates) to physical _integrated_ flux units. The `photeq` task in `Drizzlepac` automates this image intensity rescaling to a single inverse-sensitivity factor `PHOTFLAM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example notebook, archival WFPC2 images are used to demonstrate advanced reprocessing using `TweakReg` and `AstroDrizzle` for alignment and image combination. The notebook is based on a prior WFPC2 [example](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/drizzlepac/examples/example7) but includes additional information about equalizing the chip sensitivities prior to combining. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** It is important to note that `photeq` only adjusts image counts so that _integrated_ physical fluxes can be obtained using a single `PHOTFLAM`. It does nothing to account for different throughtputs at different wavelengths."
