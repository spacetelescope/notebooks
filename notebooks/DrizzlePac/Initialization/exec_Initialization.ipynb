    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "DrizzlePac is a Python software package developed at STScI that is designed to align and combine HST images and is a successor to the older MultiDrizzle software. Since July 2012, all drizzled data products obtained from MAST are produced with AstroDrizzle. \n",
    "\n",
    "An abbreviation for Astrometric Drizzle, AstroDrizzle was designed from the ground-up to substantially improve the handling of distortion in the image header World Coordinate System. AstroDrizzle removes geometric distortion, corrects for sky background variations, flags cosmic-rays, and combines images with optional subsampling. Drizzled data products from MAST are generated for single visit associations only.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine data from additional visits, TweakReg may be used to update the image WCS using matched source lists. Once the full set of images of a given target are properly aligned, they may be combined using AstroDrizzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the DrizzlePac software has been optimized to work with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, it can work with other types of data so long as the images adhere to the FITS standards for multi-extension files and for describing the World Coordinate System (WCS). It assumes that all distortions have been properly described in the WCS of the image, e.g. via the SIP distortion coefficients. [More details may be found here](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/drizzlepac/adfeatures) under the section 'Aligning to Non-HST Image'. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to set up your environment to analyze HST data with links to several resources, as well as a demonstration of how to download observations from the HST archive and their associated reference files."

    "**Notes about HST files:**\n",
    "\n",
    "HST images are stored using the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS). In particular, HST data use a multi-extension FITS (MEF) format. In this format, science data, error arrays, and data quality information for a single observation are stored as different extensions within a single file. The data format for the detector you are working with may be found in your instrument's data handbook, e.g. for [WFC3](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/handbooks/currentDHB/wfc3_cover.html) and [ACS](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/handbooks/currentDHB/acs_cover.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recent changes to ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS data quality flags:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In early 2017, the ACS instrument team changed the definition of data quality (DQ) flags populated in the calibrated FLT/FLC files. New calibration techniques now make it possible discern between unstable and stable hot pixels, the later of which are corrected by ‘calacs’ when subtracting the dark. Thus, pixels identified as hot and stable (DQ flag=16) may now be treated as 'good' data when drizzling, and those identified as unstable (DQ flag=32) should be treated as 'bad'. A new MDRIZTAB reference table (16r12191j_mdz.fits) was delivered in June 2017 and contains a set of default parameters for combining exposures with AstroDrizzle. With changes to the DQ flag definitions, the parameters 'driz_sep_bits' and 'final_bits', which define DQ flags for drizzle to ignore (e.g. to treat as good), are now set to a value of 336 (the sum of 16+64+256) so that stable hot pixels, warm pixels, and full-well saturated pixels will not be rejected when combining exposures. For details, see [ACS ISR 2017-05](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/isrs/isr1705.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The WFC3 instrument team implemented a similar change to the DQ flag definitions in December 2018, and an updated MDRIZTAB reference file (2ck18260i_mdz.fits) reflects the new recommended drizzle parameter settings such that DQ flag values 16, 64, and 256 are treated as good pixels. These new flags are valid for UVIS observations obtained after Nov 08 2012, when the dark calibration program began using post-flash to mitigate hot pixel trailing due to poor charge transfer efficiency at low background levels. A description of the new UVIS bad pixel tables is described in [WFC3 ISR 2018-15](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/ISRs/WFC3-2018-15.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "This new set of DrizzlePac notebooks takes into account the updated DQ parameter settings for processing both ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS data. Similar updates to WFC3/IR data quality flags will be implemented in early 2019."

    "**Please be sure you have the latest version of AstroConda.** The AstroConda page on [updating your software stack](https://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/updating.html) goes into more detail, but you can update your base `conda` installation and *everything* installed in your AstroConda environment (assuming it is named \"astroconda\") by typing in a bash shell:\n",

    "In addition to the default AstroConda configuration, many DrizzlePac examples will use [astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to obtain data from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). To install this, type the following in your bash shell:\n",
