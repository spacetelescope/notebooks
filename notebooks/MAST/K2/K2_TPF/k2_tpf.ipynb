    "A target pixel file contains the raw and calibrated fluxes for the pixels downloaded at either 1-minute (short) or 30-minute (long) cadence.  It also contains information about the aperture, including which pixels were used to calculate the total flux, which pixels were used to estimate the background flux, and which pixels were used to calculate the flux weighted or pixel response function centroids.  The data shown here will be for the star TRAPPIST-1 (the standard readout is EPIC 246199087, a larger readout for this star was also obtained with a K2 ID of EPIC 200164267), which is known to host a system of seven Earth-sized planets.\n",

    "* Campaign = During the K2 mission, the Kepler telescope observed the sky in a given pointing along the ecliptic plane for approximately 80 days at a time. Each of these regions is referred to as a \"Campaign\", starting with Campaign 0 and ending with Campaign 19. There was also a special \"Engineering\" Campaign before Campaign 0 that lasted ~10 days.\n",
    "* HDU = Header Data Unit.  A FITS file is made up of HDUs that contain data and metadata relating to the file. The first HDU is called the primary HDU, and anything that follows is considered an \"extension\", e.g., \"the first FITS extension\", \"the second FITS extension\", etc.\n",

You can find a summary of what the different values mean [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/archive_manual.pdf#page=20).  For example, a pixel in the aperture that might have a value of 15 can be broken down into power of 2 like: 8+4+2+1 = 15.  Referencing the table of values, this means this particular pixel was in was used to calculate the Pixel Response Function (PRF) centroid, was used to calculate the flux weighted centroid, was part of the optimal photometric aperture, and was collected by the spacecraft.  Numpy has a bulit-in function that can convert an integer into a binary bit mask.  Let's use that now one one of the common values we see in our displayed image above."
