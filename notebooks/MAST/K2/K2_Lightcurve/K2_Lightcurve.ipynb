    "A light curve is a plot of flux versus time, and is used to identify variability, including the transits of orbiting companions like planets.  The light curve shown here will be for the star TRAPPIST-1 (the K2 ID for the standard readout is EPIC 246199087, a larger readout for this star was also obtained with a K2 ID of EPIC 200164267).  TRAPPIST-1 is known to host a system of seven Earth-sized planets.\n",

    "This tutorial will refer to a couple K2-related terms that we define here.\n",
    "* Campaign = During the K2 mission, the Kepler telescope observed the sky in a given pointing along the ecliptic plane for approximately 80 days at a time.  Each of these regions is referred to as a \"Campaign\", starting with Campaign 0 and ending with Campaign 19. There was also a special \"Engineering\" Campaign before Campaign 0 that lasted ~10 days.\n",
    "* HDU = Header Data Unit.  A FITS file is made up of HDUs that contain data and metadata relating to the file. The first HDU is called the primary HDU, and anything that follows is considered an \"extension\", e.g., \"the first FITS extension\", \"the second FITS extension\", etc.\n",
    "* BJD = Barycentric Julian Date, the Julian Date that has been corrected for differences in the Earth's position with respect to the Solar System center of mass.\n",
    "* BKJD =  Barycentric Kepler Julian Date, the timestamp measured in BJD, but offset by 2454833.0.  I.e., BKJD = BJD - 2454833.0\n",
    "* WCS = World Coordinate System, A FITS convention used to store coordinate information inside FITS headers.  For K2 full frame images, it is used to provide the translation needed to go from pixel coorindates to celestial coordinates in right ascension and declination.\n",
    "* SAP Flux = Simple Aperture Photometry flux, the flux after summing the calibrated pixels within the K2 optimal photometric aperture.\n",
    "* PDCSAP Flux = Pre-search Data Conditioned Simple Aperture Photometry, the SAP flux values nominally corrected for instrumental variations.  Thus, these fluxes are the mission's best estimate of the intrinsic variability of the target."

You can find a summary of what the different values mean [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/archive_manual.pdf#page=20).  For example, a pixel in the aperture that might have a value of 15 can be broken down into power of 2 like: 8+4+2+1 = 15.  Referencing the table of values, this means this particular pixel was used to calculate the Pixel Response Function (PRF) centroid, was used to calculate the flux weighted centroid, was part of the optimal photometric aperture, and was collected by the spacecraft.  Numpy has a bulit-in function that can convert an integer into a binary bit mask.  Let's use that now on one of the common values we see in our displayed image above."
