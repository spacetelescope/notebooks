Each of these regions is referred to as a \"Campaign\", starting with Campaign 0 and ending with Campaign 19. There was also a special \"Engineering\" Campaign before Campaign 0 that lasted ~10 days.\n",
    "* HDU = Header Data Unit.  A FITS file is made up of HDUs that contain data and metadata relating to the file. The first HDU is called the primary HDU, and anything that follows is considered an \"extension\", e.g., \"the first FITS extension\", \"the second FITS extension\", etc.\n",

Note that all 84 modules are included in the FFI FITS file, even if some of them do not have image data.  Let's examine the structure of the FITS file using the astropy.fits `info` function, which shows the FITS file format in more detail.
