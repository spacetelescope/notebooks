    "This notebook is a beginner tutorial on the Zcut feature of the MAST astroquery interface. Zcut allows you to request cutouts — either as `.fits` or image files — from various deep field surveys. The list of supported deep field surveys can be found here: https://mast.stsci.edu/zcut/\n",

    "In this tutorial, you'll learn to:\n",

    "1. Use RA/Dec coordinates to search for surveys containing your target\n",
    "2. Create a cutout from deep field surveys\n",
