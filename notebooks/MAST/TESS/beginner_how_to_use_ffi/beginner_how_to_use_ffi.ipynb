    "TESS periodically reads out the entire frame of all four cameras, nominally every 30 minutes, and stores them as full frame images.  Each camera covers ~24x24 degrees on the sky.  These images can be used to construct light curves at 30-minute cadence for any object within the camera's field of view, in contrast to the subset of targets chosen by the mission to be read-out at shorter cadence (nominally two minutes) that receive mission-produced light curves.\n",

    "* Sector = TESS observes the sky in regions of 24x96 degrees for approximately 1 month at a time.  Each of these regions is referred to as a \"sector\", starting with Sector 1.\n",
    "* HDU = Header Data Unit.  A FITS file is made up of HDUs that contain data and metadata relating to the file. The first HDU is called the primary HDU, and anything that follows is considered an \"extension\", e.g., \"the first FITS extension\", \"the second FITS extension\", etc.\n",
    "* BJD = Barycentric Julian Date, the Julian Date that has been corrected for differences in the Earth's position with respect to the Solar System center of mass.\n",
    "* BTJD =  Barycentric TESS Julian Date, the timestamp measured in BJD, but offset by 2457000.0.  I.e., BTJD = BJD - 2457000.0\n",
    "* WCS = World Coordinate System, A FITS convention used to store coordinate information inside FITS headers.  For TESS full frame images, it is used to provide the translation needed to go from pixel coorindates to celestial coordinates in right ascension and declination."
