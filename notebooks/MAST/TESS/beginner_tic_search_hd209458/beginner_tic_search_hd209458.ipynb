    "# Beginner: Search The TESS Input Catalog Centered On HD 209458.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tutorial demonstrates how to do a cone search centered on the location of a target (in this example, the star HD 209458) in the TESS Input Catalog.  We will then select a subset of the returned targets based on their Luminosity Class values.  Finally, we will identify the TIC object that is closest on the sky to HD 209458 as a means to determine the star's TIC number.  This tutorial uses Python and the astroquery module.  Information on how to install astroquery for MAST can be found on the [Astroquery site](http://astroquery.readthedocs.io/)."

    "We will now use the Catalogs `query_object` function to do a cone search centered on HD 209458 and return the rows from the TIC catalog.  The function makes use of MAST's name resolver to convert a target name (as a string) into coordinates (Right Ascension and Declination).  Many types of ID's are possible, including any string that can be resolved by Simbad or NED, as well as any target in the Kepler Input Catalog, K2 EPIC Catalog, or the TESS Input Catalog.  The function also can accept a search radius size (specified in degrees), and it needs to know which catalog you want to query.  Catalog options are listed on [this page](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html#catalog-queries).\n",
