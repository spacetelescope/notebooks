    "# Beginner: Retrieve TESS Data Validation Products with Astroquery\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to producing light curves and target pixel files, TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satelite) searches the 2-minute light curve data for transiting exoplanets. The mission does the search on individual sectors. But it also does multi-sector searches where they stitch the time series from a range of sectors and then do a search.  For every star in a particular search that produces a significant transiting event, a set of Data Validation products are created. The set of products are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DV reports (pdf), one per star\n",
    "- DV summaries (pdf), one per transit signal found\n",
    "- DV mini-reports (pdf), one per star\n",
    "- DV time series files (fits),  one per star, one extension per transit signal\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we show how to use astroquery to request all of the DV files available for a star of interest (L98-59 in this case). We then open the DV time series file to plot the detrended light curves produced by the mission and also a folded light curve for each signal found by the mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skills explored in this notebook:\n",

    "- Retrieving TESS timeseries observations with astroquery\n",
    "- Retrieving TESS Data Validation products with astroquery\n",
    "- Reading in a DV FITS file with astropy.io.fits\n",
    "- Plotting with Matplotlib\n",
