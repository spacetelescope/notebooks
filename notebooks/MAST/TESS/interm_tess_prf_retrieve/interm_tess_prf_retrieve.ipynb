    "# Intermediate: Retrieve TESS Pixel Response Function Images\n",
    "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satelite (TESS) takes time series data with 4 cameras across much of the sky.  The mission provides a product called the Pixel Response Function (PRF). The PRF is a model that describes the image of a point source and how it varies depending on where it lands on the detector. The shape of the image comes from the optical point spread function, jitter during observations, as well as the intra-pixel location of where the light lands.  These PRFs can be used to fit the data to obtain precise locations or brightness of stars. This notebook shows you how to open the FITS-formatted PRF images and calculate a PRF model for a specific location on a detector. \n",
    "\n",
    "More information about the PRF can be found in the [TESS Archive Manual.](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/TESS/TESS+Archive+Manual) The PRF models were created by the mission by fitting to micro-dithered data taken during PRF commissioning exercises. See the Instrument Handbook for details on the data collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pixel response functions in FITS or Matlab format and are available from the [models/prf_fitsfiles](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/models/prf_fitsfiles/) directory at MAST. There are 25 sub-pixel sampled PRF image for an evenly spaced grid across each of the 16 CCDs and cameras. Each CCD/camera combination is in its own subdirectory at MAST. The column and row information is specified in the file name.  A 13x13 PRF image is provided for 9x9 subpixel locations, allowing you a tenth of pixel precision without having to interpolate.  The 9x9 grid of 13x13 images are interwoven into one 117x117 image, making retrieving the exact sub-pixel location a bit tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no package to retrieve or work with the PRFs. So this tutorial starts by defining some functions to make it easier to parse the files and retrieve the PRF we are looking for. Each function is documented, but a quick overview is given below.   \n",
    "\n",
    "If you just want to understand the shapes of the PRFs, skip ahead to the section [Obtain PRF at an image location](#obtain_PRF).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of the PRF retrieval code\n",
    "The primary function (`getPrfAtColRowFits`) takes a column, row, ccd, camera and sector and returns a 13x13 image of the best PRF interpolated from the grid of PRFs provided in the files.  It uses the ccd, camera and sector information to determine the name of the relevant PRF file in `pathLookup`. Then `determineClosestTessColRow` uses the requested row and column, finds the 4 nearest positions on the detector for which the mission provided a PRF file. Open those files and pull out the appropriate sub-pixel image. Once the four 13x13 sub-pixel PRF images are extracted, `interpolatePrf` interpolates them to the specfied pixel location. The main function then returns this interpolated PRF image.\n",

You learned that the PRF depends not only on the location of the star on the chip, but also varies significantly by the sub-pixel location.  The wings of the PRFs depend strongly on the location of the star on the chip with the most circular shapes near the center of the image. The shape of the bright central peak of the PRF depends strongly on the sub-pixel location.  "
