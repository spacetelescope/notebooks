    "A target pixel file contains the raw and calibrated fluxes for the pixels downloaded at a cadence shorter than the full frame images.  Nominally, these are at a two-minute cadence.  It also contains information about the aperture, including which pixels were used to calculate the total flux, which pixels were used to estimate the background flux, and which pixels were used to calculate the flux weighted or pixel response function centroids.  The data shown here will be for the star TIC 25155310, which is known to host at least one planet, WASP-126 b.\n",

The first extension HDU contains more metadata in the header and stores arrays of data in a binary FITS table, which include the timestamps, fluxes, and background fluxes for each cadence of the pixels read out and downloaded by the spacecraft.  The second extension HDU contains an image that stores the pixels that were read out, and records information such as which pixels were used in the optimal photometric aperture to create the SAP fluxes.  The third extension HDU is a placeholder and is not currently used by the mission:  it can be ignored.

You can find a summary of what the different values mean [here](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/TESS/2.0+-+Data+Product+Overview#id-2.0-DataProductOverview-Table:ApertureMaskImageFlags).  For example, a pixel in the aperture that might have a value of 57 can be broken down into power of 2 like: 32+16+8+1 = 57.  Referencing the table of values, this means this particular pixel was in CCD Output A, was used to calculate the PRF centroid, was used to calculate the flux weighted centroid, and was collected by the spacecraft.  Numpy has a bulit-in function that can convert an integer into a binary bit mask.  Let's use that now one one of the common values we see in our displayed image above."
