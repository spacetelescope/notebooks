    "## Introduction\n",
    "TESS  only downloads select portions of the sky at a 2-minute cadence. The pixels collected around chosen targets are packaged in a file called the Target Pixel file. Light curve files contain the time series photometry that is derived from those pixels for each target. Each target pixel file packages these pixels as a time series of images in a binary FITS table. These files can then be used to measure the relative photometry of the observed star.  TESS also produces full frame images at a 30-minute cadence. We do not discuss those in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the TESS mission and collected data, visit the [MAST's TESS homepage](http://archive.stsci.edu/tess/). To read more details about TESS Data Products, look in the [TESS Science Product Description Document](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/doc/EXP-TESS-ARC-ICD-TM-0014.pdf). Once users understand the TESS data, a convenient software package to work with that data is called [lightkurve](https://docs.lightkurve.org/). However, we do not use it below in order to clearly show how the data in the files are organized. "

    "a) The \"rain plot\" was used in the early days of Kepler to see if there are potential shifts in the flux-weighted centroids of the star during the transits. This can be an indication that there is a background eclipsing binary causing the transit-like shape, though the evidence is not definitive.  Can you plot the motion of the star on the detector (separately in row and column) as a function of flux? Bonus points if you normalize the flux first.\n",
