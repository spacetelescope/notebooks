    "A light curve is a plot of flux versus time, and is used to identify variability, including the transits of orbiting companions like planets.  The light curve shown here will be for the star TIC 25155310, which is known to host at least one planet, WASP-126 b.\n",

    "* HDU = Header Data Unit.  A FITS file is made up of HDUs that contain data and metadata relating to the file. The first HDU is called the primary HDU, and anything that follows is considered an \"extension\", e.g., \"the first FITS extension\", \"the second FITS extension\", etc.\n",

Intringuingly, there is one measurement with a finite flux that does have one or more flags set.  It's one of the largest outliers in the positive flux direction: is this a bad measurement that should be excised from the time series?  Finding out the quality flag value and converting the value to its consitutent bit masks to understand why this point was flagged would be the first step.

You can find a summary of what the different values mean [here](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/TESS/2.0+-+Data+Product+Overview#id-2.0-DataProductOverview-Table:ApertureMaskImageFlags).  For example, a pixel in the aperture that might have a value of 57 can be broken down into power of 2 like: 32+16+8+1 = 57.  Referencing the table of values, this means this particular pixel was in CCD Output A, was used to calculate the Pixel Response Function (PRF) centroid, was used to calculate the flux weighted centroid, and was collected by the spacecraft.  Numpy has a bulit-in function that can convert an integer into a binary bit mask.  Let's use that now one one of the common values we see in our displayed image above."
