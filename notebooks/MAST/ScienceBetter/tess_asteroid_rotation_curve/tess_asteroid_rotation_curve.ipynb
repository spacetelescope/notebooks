    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "NASA's [Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/tess), was designed to detect planets orbiting bright stars. There are a number of different kinds of [TESS data products](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/data-products.html) available in the MAST archive, including:\n",
    "- FFI (full-frame image) time series contain the entire image captured by the camera taken at different times; these are large views of the sky.\n",
    "- Target Pixel Files (TPFs) are smaller subsets of full images focused on a single target. They are \"postage-stamp\" sized images separated by smaller time intervals than FFIs.\n",
    "- Light Curve Files are derived from the TPFs using Simple Aperture Photometry (SAP). \n",
    "\n",
    "Though TESS was designed to study stars and the signatures of exoplanets orbiting them, inevitably other objects are observed within the FFIs. In particular, some asteroids and comets move through the observing sectors. [Pál et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..247...26P/abstract) noted:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"While its primary mission avoids the vicinity of the ecliptic plane by approximately six degrees, the scale height of the solar system debris disk is large enough to place various small body populations in the field of view.\" \n",
    "    \n",
    "Because small bodies like asteroids and comets are moving targets, they don't have fixed RA and Dec coordinates. The MAST archive's [TESScut](https://mast.stsci.edu/tesscut/) tool has built-in features to find all of the sectors that include observations of a moving target, so long as the object's name or ID can be understood by the [JPL Horizon ephemerades interface](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#/). `TESScut` can then return a \"cutout\" of the full-frame images centered on the target as it moves through the observing sector. With this cutout, we can perform some simple aperture photometry on the target with `lightkurve`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In [Pál et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..247...26P/abstract), the bright asteroid 354 Eleonora (often just called \"Eleonora\") was found to have a rotation period of 4.27735 hours and had a mean magnitude of about 9.4 while observed by TESS. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use `TESScut` to download a cutout of the TESS observations of Eleonora and use `lightkurve` to create a light curve of Eleonora and find its rotation period. This simple method will work because Eleonora is a relatively bright asteroid. Generally, for fainter solar system objects, more complex photometry methods will be needed. We'll investigate why in one of the exercises. "
