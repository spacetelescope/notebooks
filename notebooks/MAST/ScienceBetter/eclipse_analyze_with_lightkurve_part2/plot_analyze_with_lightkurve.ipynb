    "From Part 1 of this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The [Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2)](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/apogee-2/)  observed near-infrared spectra of hundreds of thousands of stars in our Milky Way. This survey was used to search for stars with spectral lines showing the tell-tale radial velocity shifts associated with stellar binaries. Near the end of the APOGEE-2 survey, the [Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)](https://tess.mit.edu/) was launched to search for exoplanets using the transit method; eclipses of primary stars by companion stars would also be observable by TESS. Finding a stellar system that has been observed by both surveys would provide confirmation of the properties of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    ">In this tutorial, we will load a catalog of binary stellar systems discovered through the radial velocity method and investigate if those systems also have light curves in the MAST archive from the TESS mission. Two sources for those already processed light curves are the TESS Data for Asteroseismology Lightcurves archive from TASOC (the TESS Asteroseismic Science Operations Center) or in the TESS Lightcurves From The MIT Quick-Look Pipeline (\"QLP\") archive. Though we'll focus on a narrow set of eclipsing binaries with previously-measured properties, the radial velocity catalog we'll be working with has nearly 5000 stellar systems that are yet to be fully characterized. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll actually view and analyze the light curves for just one of the radial velocity-selected stellar systems to see if we can observe an eclipse in the TESS data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow for this notebook consists of:\n",
    "- Examining and Plotting the Light Curve FITS files\n",
    "    - Exercise 1\n",
    "- Combining Multiple Light Curve Products using lightkurve\n",
