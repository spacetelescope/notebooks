    "1. An alternative method to narrowing down candidates from Table 4a: Instead of filtering by ```Per``` and sorting by qmin, filter by some qmin value (such as > 0.3) and then sort by period from lowest to highest. Still require Conv=1. How do your resulting tables vary? Which one do you think would be most helpful in trying to find eclipses, and why? \n",
    "2. An alternative method to searching astroquery in a loop: Export the APOGEE name, RA, and Dec from our filtered version of Table 4a (`tbl`) above to a .csv file, and use the Upload Target List feature on the online MAST Portal to search for QLP and TASOC observations in bulk. Hint: After cross-referencing your uploaded list to all MAST observations, filter (in the left hand column) by Mission: HLSP and Product Type: time series. Reference the [Writing Tables](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/ascii/write.html) page of the astropy documentation and [Search a List of Targets](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Search+a+List+of+Targets) from MAST for help. Export the data (list of all HLSP light curves) to a local file and load it into this notebook. Compared to our loop above, which method is faster? Which is easier to find what you need?"
