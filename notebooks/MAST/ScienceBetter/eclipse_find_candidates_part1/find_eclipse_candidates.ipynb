    "## Introduction\n",
    "Just like extrasolar planets, binary star systems can be discovered by multiple methods. The two stars orbit around their mutual center of mass, so all three methods rely on detecting the signatures of this motion. Three of the methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Astrometry. For binaries whose plane of orbit is perpendicular (or nearly perpendicular) to our line of sight, we may be able to actually see stars (or just the primary star) moving back and forth relative to the more distant background stars. \n",
    "2. Radial velocity. For binaries whose plane of orbit is more aligned with our line of sight, their spectroscopic emission and absorption lines will be periodically blueshifted and redshifted as the star moves towards and away from us, respectively. In the catalog we will use, it is the radial velocity of only the primary (brighter) star that is detected. \n",
    "3. Eclipses. When the dimmer star passes in front of the brighter star, a notable drop in the brightness of the stellar system can be detected. This dip in brightness is analogous to the transit of an exoplanet in front of a star. Depending on the difference in brightness of the two stars, a secondary eclipse may also be detectable when the dimmer star passes behind the brighter star. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2)](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/apogee-2/) observed near-infrared spectra of hundreds of thousands of stars in our Milky Way. This survey was used to search for stars with spectral lines showing the tell-tale radial velocity shifts associated with stellar binaries. Near the end of the APOGEE-2 survey, the [Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)](https://tess.mit.edu/) was launched to search for exoplanets using the transit method; eclipses of primary stars by companion stars would also be observed by TESS. Finding a stellar system that has been observed by both surveys would provide confirmation of the properties of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will load a catalog of binary stellar systems discovered through the radial velocity method and investigate if those systems also have light curves in the MAST archive from the TESS mission. Two sources for those already processed light curves are the TESS Data for Asteroseismology Lightcurves archive from TASOC (the TESS Asteroseismic Science Operations Center) or in the TESS Lightcurves From The MIT Quick-Look Pipeline (\"QLP\") archive. Though we'll focus on a narrow set of eclipsing binaries with previously-measured properties, the radial velocity catalog we'll be working with has nearly 5000 stellar systems that are yet to be fully characterized. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 2 (`plot_analyze_with_lightkurve`), we'll actually view and analyze the light curves. \n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow for this notebook consists of:\n",
    "- Loading the APOGEE Binary Radial Velocity catalog from VizieR\n",
    "- Narrowing down the list of stellar systems in the catalog's Table 4\n",
    "- Searching the TASOC and QLP archives for a light curve by coordinate\n",
