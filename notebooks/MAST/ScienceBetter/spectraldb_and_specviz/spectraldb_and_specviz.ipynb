    "The Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) is the home for all data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), among other telescope data archives. There are multiple ways to search for and download images and spectra from MAST. In this tutorial, we will define pixel-level criteria to search high-level spectral data products available in the [ `SpectralDB` Application Programming Interface (API)](https://mast.stsci.edu/spectra/docs/). Using a correctly formatted URL (Uniform Resource Locator; a web address that starts with https://) request to the Spectral Pixel Search API, we will receive a list of all pixels and spectra that meet the criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will choose one spectrum and use its Uniform Resource Indicator (URI) to format a correct URL to request the spectrum from `SpectralDB`. With the API we can directly access the same content as contained with a .fits file in our Jupyter notebook *without* having to download and store the .fits file locally. Finally, this tutorial will briefly demonstrate how to plot the spectrum in the `Specviz` portion of `Jdaviz`. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this tutorial, not all publicly available taken by JWST is available through `SpectralDB`; it currently only contains the final calibrated data science products (\"Level 3\" products), not lower level calibration products. Additionally, searching for 2D and 3D spectroscopic pixel data is not yet supported. The filename of a 1D spectroscopic products, which are supported in searching, will all end in `_x1d.fits`. This tutorial retrieves publicly available data, which we can do anonymously; to retrieve proprietary or protected data, you will need to use an authentication token. \n",

    "\n",
    "There are many ways to search the MAST database, such as with [`astroquery`](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html) in Python or with the [MAST Portal](https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html) in your web browser. These types of searches are usually designed to be done by object name, region, or proposal or observation ID; in other words, the searches are usually done based on the observing target or the observing plan (such as proposer, instrument, filters, etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "The SpectralDB is a new database holding the pixel-level information for spectroscopic dataproducts. Using the Spectral Pixel Search API, we can search the SpectralDB by pixel-level information within the spectrum itself, such as signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), or flux values in certain wavelength ranges; we can search by the actual result of the observation, in addition to typical search criteria above. More documentation is available about how to [Search Spectroscopic Pixel Data](https://mast.stsci.edu/spectra/docs/search_pixels.html) \n",
    "\n",
    "The URLs for searching with the Spectral Pixel Search API will all begin with `https://mast.stsci.edu/spectra/api/v0.1/search?` and then be followed by the appropriate keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we search for 1D spectra (`product=x1d`) that have a flux of at least 0.2 Jy (`flux.gte=0.2`) in the wavelength range of 14 to 14.5 microns (`wavelength=14,14.5`). We search for spectra with a global SNR of at least 5 (`&derSnr.gt=5`) The `&` signs between our keywords indicate that the pixels should satisfy *all* of the criteria. \n",
    "All of the columns in our query will automaticlaly returned in the search results, but we might also want other columns that were are not searching for. So, finally, we will use the `columns` keyword to specify that we would also like the API to return the target's name, RA, and Dec along with the spectral information.\n"
