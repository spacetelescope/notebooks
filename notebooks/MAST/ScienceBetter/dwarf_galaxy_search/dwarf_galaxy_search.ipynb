    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of dwarf galaxies that are gravitationally bound to the Milky Way. These satellites are small and generally faint companions in the Local Group that are not observable with the naked eye, except for the Large and Small Magenllanic Cloud. These satellites are classified into two major classes: Classical dwarf spheroidal and ultra-faint dwarf (UDF) galaxies. Classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies are small, low-luminosity galaxies with very little dust and an older stellar population ([Metz et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.376..387M/abstract)). Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies contain from a few hundred to one hundred thousand stars, making them the faintest galaxies in the Universe ([Simon et al. 2019](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-astro-091918-104453)).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be searching the [Pan-STARRS](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS/) catalog for data on an already discovered dwarf spheroidal galaxy and then try to search if there are other MAST data associated with the galaxy. The methods we use in this notebook can be extended to find new dwarf galaxies but in this application we will be using the MAST archive and its tools to search PS1 for data on an already known target. To choose our target, we will be referencing the paper \"Milky Way Satellite Census. I. The Observational Selection Function for Milky Way Satellites in DES Y3 and Pan-STARRS DR1\" by [Drlica-Wagner et al. 2020](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab7eb9).\n",
    "\n",
    "After searching PS1 for data on our target, we will use the data to plot a color-magnitude diagram of the galaxy and also plot an image of the field of view of our target. Next, we will choose another target (a UFD galaxy) repeat the steps of gathering PS1 data, and compare both target's color-magnitude diagrams. Lastly, we will search Hubble Space Telescope data to download the data products available for our first target. \n"

    "## Plot Color-Magnitude Diagram (CMD) of Leo I\n",
    "\n",
    "Color-Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs) are a common way astronomers visualize the photometric parameters of a stellar system. Where the stars of a system fall on a CMD can tell you things like the age of that system and therefore, what types of stars it is composed of. The colors of a system can also tell us about the temperature of that system. Color in astronomy is defined to be the difference between the magnitude in one filter and the magnitude in another filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gather arrays for plotting\n",
    "A CMD consists of the magnitude in one filter (vertical-axis) vs the difference between the magnitude in that filter and the magnitude in another filter (horizontal-axis). For this example we will plot the magnitude of **Leo I** in g vs the magnitude of **Leo I** in g-r. Additionally, we'll take a look at the CMD in r-i so that you can see how to plot multiple types of CMDs for future reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "What CMDs show is the relationship between the magnitude of the signal we have detected in different color filters, so in this case a larger value for g (bluer filter) minus r (red filter) means the star is redder, and a smaller g-r value means the star is bluer. A larger value in r (red) minus i (even more red) means the star is redder, and a smaller r-i value means the star is bluer. In order to plot these CMDs we will need a few numpy arrarys to store these magnitudes (g,r,i).\n"
