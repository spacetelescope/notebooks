    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "* Understand how to query data on a target from the MAST archive.\n",
    "* Be able to plot a Historial Observational Coverage plot of a target.\n",
    "* Know how to plot a Hubble Spectrum for a target.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Quasars are extremely luminous astronomical objects that can be found at the center of some galaxies. They are powered by gas spiraling at high velocity into a super-massive black hole. The brightest quasars are capable of outshining all the stars in their galaxy; they can be seen from billions of light-years away. The first quasar ever discovered is called **3c273**. It is one of the most luminous quasars and therefore one of the most luminous objects in the observable universe. It is at a distance of 749 Megaparsecs [1 Megaparsec = 1 million parsecs = 3.26 million lightyears] with an absolute magnitude of âˆ’26.7, meaning that if it were at a distance of 10 parsecs, it would be as bright in our sky as the Sun. \n",
    "\n",
    "Quasar **3c273** is the our target in this tutorial. We will first search the MAST Archive for all the observations of this quasar. Then, we will display those observations in a historic coverage plot; that is, a plot of the wavelengths in which **3c273** was observed for a given year. This will help us understand what the history of observations of this quasar looks over time. Finally, we will plot a spectrum from one of the observations. \n",
