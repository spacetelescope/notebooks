    "# Surveying dust structure via GALEX MIS - Part 1\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand UV images and how they are useful to study dust\n",
    "- Navigate the GALEX MIS catalog\n",
    "- Learn how to adjust the constrast of an image using `ZScaleInterval`\n",
    "- Correctly display the coordinate range that an image covers from its central coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**GALEX background**: The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) was a satellite which mission was to produce an All-sky Imaiging Survey (AIS). It observed the sky in two different bands: in the Near UV (NUV) ($1750-27504$ Å) and in the Far UV (FUV) ($1350-1750$ Å). The GALEX database contains over 600 million source measurements in the ultraviolet domain, with some sources having more than one measurement, which could be useful to look for variability. \n",
    "\n",
    "**GALEX Medium Imaging survey (MIS) background**: Single orbit exposures (1,500s) of 1000 square degrees in positions that match the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). These images present a higher resolution in comparison with AIS since their exposure time was longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining some terms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intensity map**: image that displays the photons per pixel per second corrected for the relative response of the instrument used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clouds can be visible in UV when they are found close to hot stars. The objective of this tutorial is to extract and display an intensity map image of a high-latitude cloud retrieved from GALEX MIS. High-latitude clouds (Galactic latitude: $|b| > 20-30º$) are interesting because they are considered ideal candidates to study triggered star formation. Triggered star formation occurs when molecular clouds are compressed by wind or shocks until the point in which star formation starts, for more information on this topic please refer to [Li et al. (2014)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.444.2884L/abstract).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is divided in two parts. In Part 1, you will learn how to navigate the GALEX MIS database through the MAST portal, download and display the intensity maps for specific coordinates, and understand how to properly display the contents of these images. In Part 2, we will use this method to create a mosaic by combining several of these images and study dust clouds.\n",
