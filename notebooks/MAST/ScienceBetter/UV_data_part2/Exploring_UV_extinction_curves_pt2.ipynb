    "- Understand what a UV extinction curve is and how it is used to study dust properties\n",

    "- Parametrize a curve based on your UV extinction curve\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extinction curve background**: An extinction curve represents the wavelength dependence of dust extinction. It compares the inherent Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) (~dust-free) of a star to the observed SED affected by dust extinction. Normally these curves are created by plotting $k(\\lambda-V)$ versus $1/\\lambda$, with $\\lambda$ being the wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extinction is relevant in many different scenarios. Dust can be found very near the observed object – such as stars having disks or proto-stellar clouds surrounding it – or can be far away from it but still affect the observation performed – for example dust in a galaxy that happens to be between the observer and the star.\n",
    "\n",
    "**International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE)**: The IUE performed spectrophotometry in the wavelength range going from 1150 Å to 3200 Å. More than 100,000 spectra collected by the IUE between 1978 and 1996 can be accessed via the [MAST portal](https://archive.stsci.edu/iue/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Magellanic Clouds**: irregular dwarf galaxies that orbit the Milky Way galaxy and are located in the southern celestial hemisphere. Two distinct groups can be differentiated: the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining some terms**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Color index**: difference between magnitude of a star in 2 different passbands, typically B and V. Symbol: $(B-V)$. \n",
    "- **Extinction**: absoption and scattering of light by dust and gas between an object and the observer. It is a measure of the interstellar reddening quantified by the difference between the magnitude of the band when observed through dust versus a dust-free environment. Symbol: $A(\\lambda)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spectral type**: stellar classification from hotter (O stars) to cooler (M stars). Temperature defines a star's \"color\" and surface brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Useful equations**\n",
    "- $k(\\lambda-V) = \\frac{m(\\lambda-V)-m(\\lambda-V)_o}{(B-V)-(B-V)_o} = \\frac{A(\\lambda)-A(V)}{A(B)-A(V)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note**: the $x_o$ terms refer to the star that is nearly unaffected by dust, i.e. $(B-V)$ corresponds to the observed color index and $(B-V)_o$ to the observed color index if there was no extinction due to dust. The stars should have the same spectral type in order to perform this comparison._\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [Fitzpatrick and Massa (1990) parametrization](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ApJS...72..163F/abstract): this will be the parametrization that will be followed in this tutorial for extinction curves. This parametrization is a combination of three elements; a linear \"background term\"; a Lorentsian-like \"Drude\" profile for the 2175 Å bump, $D(x; \\gamma, x_o)$; finally, a far-UV curvature term, $F(x)$. The $x$ in the equation corresponds to $x = \\lambda^{-1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    " k(x-V) = c_1 + c_2x + c_3D(x; \\gamma, x_o)+c_4F(x)\n",
    "\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    " D(x; \\gamma, x_o) = \\frac{x^2}{(x^2-x_o^2)^2+x^2\\gamma^2}\n",

    "This tutorial is divided in two parts. In Part 1, you will learn how to navigate the IUE database through the MAST portal, download and save to your local computer the fluxes and their corresponding wavelengths of different stars, one reddened and one unreddened one. In Part 2, we will use these stars spectra to construct and plot UV extinction curves.  \n",
