    "**Extinction curve background**: An extinction curve represents the wavelength dependence of dust extinction. It compares the inherent Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) (~dust-free) of a star to the observed SED affected by dust extinction. Normally these curves are created by plotting $k(\\lambda-V)$ versus $1/\\lambda$, with $\\lambda$ being the wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extinction is relevant in many different scenarios. Dust can be found very near the observed object – such as stars having disks or proto-stellar clouds surrounding it – or can be far away from it but still affect the observation performed – for example dust in a galaxy that happens to be between the observer and the star.\n",
    "\n",
    "**International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE)**: The IUE performed spectrophotometry in the wavelength range going from 1150 Å to 3200 Å. More than 100,000 spectra collected by the IUE between 1978 and 1996 can be accessed via the [MAST portal](https://archive.stsci.edu/iue/).\n",

    "- **Color index**: difference between magnitude of a star in 2 different passbands, typically B and V. Symbol: $(B-V)$. \n",
    "- **Extinction**: absoption and scattering of light by dust and gas between an object and the observer. It is a measure of the interstellar reddening quantified by the difference between the magnitude of the band when observed through dust versus a dust-free environment. Symbol: $A(\\lambda)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spectral type**: stellar classification from hotter (O stars) to cooler (M stars). Temperature defines a star's \"color\" and surface brightness.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Useful equations**\n",
    "- $k(\\lambda-V) = \\frac{m(\\lambda-V)-m(\\lambda-V)_o}{(B-V)-(B-V)_o} = \\frac{A(\\lambda)-A(V)}{A(B)-A(V)}$\n",

    "_**Note**: the $x_o$ terms refer to the star that is nearly unaffected by dust, i.e. $(B-V)$ corresponds to the observed color index and $(B-V)_o$ to the observed color index if there was no extinction due to dust. The stars should have the same spectral type in order to perform this comparison._\n",
