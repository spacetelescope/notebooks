    "\n",
    "* Know to how to login/logout to access data in astroquery.\n",

    "There are several ways to enter your token, including:\n",
    "1. Manual response to prompt from `Observations.login()` (must be done every time)\n",
    "2. Python keyring; either through the `keyring` library or `Observations.login`\n",
    "3. Storing it in the bash environment variable `$MAST-API-TOKEN`\n",
