    "When presenting any visuals and/or plots from the data, make sure you are using color palettes that are color-blind friendly and using language that keeps accessibility in mind. The most common form of color vision deficiency involves differentiating between red and green, so avoiding colormaps with both red and green will avoid many problems in general. Use descriptive keywords not pertaining to the color of the object you are referring to. It is good practice to make your plots and images large enough to ensure that important details are not hard to see. On the same note, make sure that tick labels, legends, and other plot notations are not too small, and make sure they are descriptive enough that the user can understand what is being represented by the data.
