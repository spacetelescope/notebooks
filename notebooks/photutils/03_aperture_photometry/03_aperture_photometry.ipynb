    "##### What is aperture photometry?\n",
    "The most common method to measure the flux of a celestial source is aperture photometry. This kind of photometry measures the amount of flux within a region of an astronomical image of defined shape and size (an aperture) surrounding a source. The ideal aperture would capture all of the flux emitted by a desired source, and none of the flux emitted by the surrounding sky or nearby sources. Especially when performing photometry on image data that includes a number of sources with varying size and shape, it is important to perform aperture corrections to account for imperfect apertures and better constrain photometric errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `photutils` package provides tools for performing photometry with apertures of various shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What does this tutorial include?\n",
    "This tutorial covers how to perform aperture photometry with `photutils`, including the following methods:\n",
    "* Creating Apertures\n",
    "    * Circular Apertures\n",
    "    * Elliptical Apertures\n",
    "    * Sky Apertures with WCS\n",
    "* Performing Aperture Photometry\n",
    "* Calculating Aperture Corrections with Local Background Subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Which data are used in this tutorial?\n",
    "We will be manipulating Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) data, which was collected using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on Hubble between 2002 and 2012. The image we use here is the result of 1.8 million seconds (500 hours!) of exposure time, and includes some of the faintest and most distant galaxies that have ever been observed. \n",
