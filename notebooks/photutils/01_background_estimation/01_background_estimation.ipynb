    "##### What is background estimation?\n",
    "In order to most accurately do photometric analysis of celestial sources in image data, it is important to estimate and subtract the image background. Any astronomical image will have background noise, due to both detector effects and background emission from the night sky. This noise can be modeled as uniform, or as varying with position on the detector. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `photutils` package provides tools for estimating 2-dimensional background noise, which can then be subtracted from an image to ensure the most accurate photometry possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What does this tutorial include?\n",
    "This tutorial covers the basics of background estimation and subtraction, including the following methods:\n",
    "- Scalar Background Estimation\n",
    "- 2-D Background Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Which data are used in this tutorial?\n",
    "We will be manipulating Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) data, which was collected using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on Hubble between 2002 and 2012. The image we use here is the result of 1.8 million seconds (500 hours!) of exposure time, and includes some of the faintest and most distant galaxies that have ever been observed. \n",
