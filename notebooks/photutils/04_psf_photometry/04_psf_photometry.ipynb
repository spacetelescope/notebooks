    "##### What is PSF photometry?\n",
    "A more specific form of photometry than aperture photometry, PSF photometry takes into account the shape of a source's point spread function (PSF). The PSF is a model that represents the distribution of light from a point source as it falls onto a detector. An example of a basic PSF is simply a 2-D Gaussian, while more complex PSFs can include distortion, diffraction, or interference effects associated with a particular telescope. For instance, the PSFs from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope have been meticulously modeled, and can be simulated with the [Tiny Tim](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/focus/TinyTim) and [WebbPSF](https://github.com/mperrin/webbpsf) software packages, respectively. However, for datasets that do not have readily available PSF models, such models can be statistically generated by analyzing the image itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `photutils` package provides tools that combine background estimation, source detection, and model-fitting to perform PSF photometry on image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What does this tutorial include?\n",
    "This tutorial covers how to perform PSF photometry with `photutils`, including the following methods:\n",
    "* Gaussian PSF Photometry\n",
    "* Iterative Subtraction\n",
    "* Point Response Function (PRF) Photometry\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Which data are used in this tutorial?\n",
    "We will be manipulating Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) data, which was collected using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on Hubble between 2002 and 2012. The image we use here is the result of 1.8 million seconds (500 hours!) of exposure time, and includes some of the faintest and most distant galaxies that have ever been observed. \n",
    "\n",
    "*The methods demonstrated here are available in narrative form within the `photutils.psf` [documentation](http://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/psf.html).*"
